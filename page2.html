    <title>TYPES OF CERAMICS THAT WE MAKE</title>
    <h1 style="background-color: lightblue;">EARTHENWARE CERAMICS</h1>
    <img src="earthenware.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="400px"><img src="earthen 3.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="400px">
    <p>Earthenware,This is where we have pottery that has not been fired to the point of vitrification and is thus slightly porous and coarser than stoneware and porcelain. The body can be covered completely or decorated with slip (a liquid clay mixture applied before firing), or it can be glazed</p>
    <h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">STONEWARE CERAMICS.</h2>
    <img src="stone 1.jpg" alt="400" height="" width="600">
  <p>Stoneware is dense pottery fired at high temperatures to make it resistant to liquids, or non-porous. It is made from clay, but is more durable than other kinds of pottery and earthenware. Stoneware gets its name from its stone-like qualities</p>
 
  <P>Some of our Customer have ask questions like "Does stoneware break easily? Like all ceramic materials, stoneware can break fairly easily when dropped on a hard surface such as floor tiles. If it's not subjected to sudden impacts it will last indefinitely, many generations can have the use of a cup or bowL </P>

  <h1 style="background-color: lightblue;"> PORCELAIN CERAMICS.</h1>
  <P>Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating substances, generally including materials such as kaolinite, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 </P>
